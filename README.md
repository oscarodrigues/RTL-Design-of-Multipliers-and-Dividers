# RTL-Design-of-Multipliers-and-Dividers

In this project, I:

• Built unsigned parallel array multipliers, unsigned Wallace tree multipliers, and unsigned parallel dividers.

• Analysed device architecture to determine most efficient register usage and least computation time.

• Refactored non-pipelined component architecture to include 6 stages of pipelining.

To open the files, download the copy of Logism within the repository. Next, under the "Simulate" tab, go to "Tick Frequency" and adjust the clock speed to your liking. Finally, enable the clock by clicking on "Ticks Enabled" under the "Simulate" tab or just press "Ctrl+K".

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
