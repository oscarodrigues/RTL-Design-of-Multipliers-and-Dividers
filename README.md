# RTL-Design-of-Multipliers-and-Dividers

In this project, I:

• Built unsigned parallel array multipliers, unsigned Wallace tree multipliers, and unsigned parallel dividers.

• Analysed device architecture to determine most efficient register usage and least computation time.

• Refactored non-pipelined component architecture to include 6 stages of pipelining.
